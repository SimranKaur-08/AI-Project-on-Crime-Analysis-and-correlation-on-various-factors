Predicting crimes before they happen is simple to understand, but it takes a lot more than understanding the concept to make it a reality. This project outlined a framework envisaging how the aspects of machine learning, along with computer vision, can help create a system that is much more helpful to the police.

The 2011 literacy data of India is taken to draw some amazing insights from the data.There could have been more visualizations,there is always the possibility but with the data we had we tried to make use of that.
